Solar System Moons AnalysisSolar System Moons Analysis
I explored the characteristics of moons in our Solar System. The project involved extracting data from Wikipedia, cleaning it, and processing it for detailed analysis. 

1. Data Cleaning and Validation: Renamed, reordered, and set indexes for columns to improve data clarity and usability. Removed irrelevant columns and utilized regular expressions for precise data extraction and formatting.

2. Interesting Facts Discovery: Analyzed the number of natural satellites each planet has, revealing Saturn and Jupiter as leaders with over 80 moons each.

3. Correlation Analysis: Investigated the relationship between the moons' Orbital Semi-Major Axis and their Sidereal Period. Found a moderately strong positive correlation, indicating that these two parameters are directly proportional.

4. Data Visualization: Employed scatter plots and heatmaps to visually represent the correlations and trends in the data. Particularly, a Log-Log model plot showcased the relationship between the Orbital Semi-Major Axis and Sidereal Period, highlighting a direct proportionality on a logarithmic scale.
